`npm init -y` create package with default "yes" parameters

`npm install lite-server --save-dev`  install lite-server as a development dependency

`npm run server` will run the lite-server because i put that in the package.json

`tsc --init` it's putting this project under control of typescript, meaning typescript will be running as well the "ts" files


However you need 2 terminals to run typescript `tsc` at one and in another to run lite-server `npm run server`


You will be writing code in index.ts file to compile your typescript scripts
